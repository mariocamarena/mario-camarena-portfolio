3) Normalize the card structure (FT-SAM vs STABLES feel mismatched)

Your two main cards don’t speak the same “layout language”:

FT-SAM card is text-heavy (bullets + paragraphs)

STABLES card is image-heavy with minimal structure

Pick one consistent pattern for all cards:

Top: image/preview (same aspect ratio)

Middle: title + 1–2 line summary

Bottom: tags + 1–2 CTAs

If you want to keep FT-SAM’s “Key Components”, hide it behind:

a “Details” accordion, or

a “Key components” link that expands on hover/click



5) CTA consistency

Right now buttons vary (“CODE/PAPER” vs “DEMO/CODE”)—good, but tighten rules:

Always show exactly 2 CTAs max

Use a clear primary action:

Research: Paper (primary) + Code (secondary)

Product/App: Demo (primary) + Code (secondary)

Also: add hover/active styles so buttons feel “alive” like the rest of the UI.

6) Alignment + grid polish

Make card heights feel more uniform (even if content differs)

Ensure the tag row always sits in the same place (bottom-aligned)

Keep consistent padding/gutters across all cards (right now the inner content density differs)
