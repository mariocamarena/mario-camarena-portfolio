1. ABOUT heading + divider (0–400ms)

Effect

Opacity: 0 → 1

Transform: translateY(+10px → 0)

Duration: ~400ms

Ease: same easeOut / spring you use for other section titles.

Why

Mirrors the hero decorative line + initial title fade/slide.

Keeps motion vertical and subtle, not floaty.

2. Text column (150–550ms)

Effect

Starts 150ms after heading.

Opacity: 0 → 1

Transform: translateY(+10px → 0) (no horizontal slide)

Duration: ~400ms

Why

Matches the Projects cards “fade-up” behavior.

Keeps focus on reading flow from left; nothing dramatic.

3. Terminal card “drag into place” (250–700ms)

Effect

Starts ~100ms after the text begins.

Opacity: 0 → 1

Transform: from a very small offset, e.g.:

translateX(-12px), translateY(-8px), maybe rotate(-1deg) → 0

No big travel distance; it’s more like a micro “nudge” than a slide.

Duration: ~450ms, smooth easeOut.

Why

Feels like it was just dropped/dragged there without doing a huge fly-in.

Direction is consistent with hero (small, subtle shifts, not big cross animations).

4. Skill chips (350–850ms, staggered)

Effect

Start once text + terminal are mostly settled (~350ms).

Each chip group (Languages / Frameworks / Tools) fades up with slight translateY(+8px → 0).

Stagger within each group by ~40ms.

Duration: ~300–400ms per group.

Why

Mirrors hero CTAs and dots appearing after the main content.

Adds polish without stealing focus from the hero or projects.


Guardrails so it feels cohesive, not overdone

Reuse hero parameters where possible

Same or very similar durations (400–600ms).

Same easing functions.

Same translate distance scale (~10–20px max).

No big horizontal cross-slides

All movement should be small and local: fade-up, slight nudge, tiny drag effect.

Limit loops

Only the terminal cursor and the status dot should loop; everything else is one-and-done on first scroll into view.

Trigger behavior

Use the same “on first intersection” behavior as Projects so it doesn’t replay aggressively when users scroll back and forth.
