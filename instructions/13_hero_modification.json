        "Increase the heading font size by roughly 40% compared to the current size on desktop.",

        "If using Tailwind, move the heading up by about one to two size steps at each relevant breakpoint (for example: base size one step larger, large/desktop size one step larger than before).",

        "Maintain clear hierarchy so the tagline is still noticeably smaller than the main name heading.",
        "Ensure comfortable line length and readability; adjust max width or line-height if the text looks too cramped.",

        "Increase the button label font size by about one size step to match the slightly larger body text.",
        "Keep the existing styling, colors, and hover/focus behavior; only adjust sizing/spacing.",

        "Allow the hero text block to occupy approximately 35–45% of the viewport width on large/desktop screens (while keeping the illustration and overall grid composition intact).",
        "If there is a max-width or similar constraint on the text block, increase it moderately so the enlarged heading and tagline have enough room without wrapping too early.",
        "Ensure spacing between heading, tagline, and buttons is adjusted proportionally so the block feels airy and intentional (no elements crammed together).",

      "If necessary, slightly reduce the scaling of the heading on very small widths to prevent awkward wrapping, while still making it feel bolder than before.",

    "Do not remove or rename existing components, routes, or navigation items.",

  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "On a desktop viewport, the main name heading is clearly larger and visually dominant, approximately 1.4x its previous size.",
    "The tagline is noticeably easier to read and about 1.2x its previous size while remaining secondary to the heading.",
    "The hero buttons feel slightly larger and more inviting, with increased padding and readable text, without breaking their layout.",
    "The right-hand text block occupies enough width that the overall hero feels visually balanced with the left illustration.",
    "No existing functionality is broken, and the hero remains fully responsive across common screen sizes."
