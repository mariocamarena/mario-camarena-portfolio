You are improving the ABOUT section of my portfolio site. The concept is good (two-terminal layout), but it needs small consistency + rhythm fixes so it feels like one cohesive “system UI” without adding complexity.

Goal:
Make the About section more visually consistent, balanced, and polished, while staying subtle and not over-engineered.

Make these changes:

1) Align the two terminals as a pair
- Snap both terminal panels to the same top baseline (top edges aligned).
- Use one consistent horizontal gutter between them.
- Make their sizing feel intentional:
  - Either same height, OR make one clearly smaller by a deliberate ratio (ex: right panel ~80% of left height).
- Slightly widen the right terminal (or slightly reduce the left) so they feel balanced, not “main + accessory.”

2) Normalize the terminal “window chrome”
Ensure BOTH terminals share identical styling for:
- border thickness + border opacity
- corner radius
- titlebar height + padding
- title text styling (size, tracking, opacity)
- window-dot size/spacing/position (and if dots are kept, keep them consistent; no random color emphasis)

3) Clean up heading hierarchy inside the left terminal
- Reduce the “too many labels” feeling.
- Keep BACKGROUND / RESEARCH / PRODUCTS as-is.
- Combine LANGUAGES + FRAMEWORKS + TOOLS into one compact SKILLS section:
  - SKILLS heading
  - 2–3 rows of chips underneath (same chip style as Projects tags)

4) Make chips consistent with the rest of the site
- Reuse the exact same chip/tag component styling used in the Projects section:
  - same border weight/opacity
  - same radius
  - same padding
  - same font size/letter spacing
  - same subtle hover behavior

5) Improve the right terminal’s “system output” alignment
- Format fields like real terminal/system output:
  - keys aligned (e.g., “role:”, “location:”, “focus:”, “status:” all start at same column)
  - values start at the same x-position
- Keep the green status dot as the ONLY strong accent color (besides optional window dots).

6) Animation consistency (subtle, matches hero)
- Use the same easing/duration as the hero section.
- Simple sequence:
  1) ABOUT title + thin rules fade/slide in
  2) both terminals fade/slide in together (left from left ~12–16px, right from right ~12–16px)
- No typewriter animation.
- Only allow one subtle loop: a single blinking cursor in ONE place (pick one panel).

Constraints:
- Do NOT add new decorative lines or extra UI ornaments.
- Keep the layout clean and readable.
- The section must feel visually interesting through composition + consistency, not extra effects.

Deliverable:
Return updated React/Next.js component code (Tailwind/shadcn if used), with the above fixes applied.
