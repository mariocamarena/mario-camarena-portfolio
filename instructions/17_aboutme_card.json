    "section": "About",
    "element": "right-side profile card with photo, name, role, focus, status",
    "goal": "Visually resemble a simple terminal window while staying fully consistent with the site’s existing dark, minimal, technical aesthetic."
  },
  "design_principles": [
    "MUST stay aligned with the rest of the site’s visual language (colors, fonts, spacing, general feel).",
    "NO over-engineering: this is a light visual treatment, not a complex component.",
    "Prefer small, clear changes over flashy effects.",
    "Maintain current layout proportions as much as possible so the About section composition is preserved."
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Do NOT introduce new colors that clash with the existing palette. Reuse existing neutrals and the existing accent color(s).",
    "Do NOT add heavy animations; any animation, if present, must be extremely subtle.",
    "Do NOT significantly change the card’s size or its approximate position relative to the left text column.",
    "Do NOT change text content or routing/behavior, only visual styling and layout.",
    "The card must remain fully readable and responsive on all breakpoints."

      "description": "Adjust card container to read more like a terminal window rather than a generic panel.",
      "requirements": [
        "Use a slightly darker background inside the card compared to the main page background, but keep it in the same tonal family.",
        "Apply a thin (1–2px) border that is slightly brighter than the card background, similar in weight to existing hero/project card outlines.",
        "Keep corners either square or only very slightly rounded, consistent with other cards on the site.",
        "Optionally add a very subtle noise or texture already used elsewhere on the site (if present), not a new visible pattern."

    "header_bar": {
      "description": "Add a simple window-style header bar at the top of the card.",
      "requirements": [
        "Create a slim horizontal bar at the top of the card with a slightly different shade than the card body (a small contrast, not a strong color block).",
        "On the left side of this bar, add three small window-control indicators (dots or tiny circles/squares) using existing neutral/soft accent colors.",
        "Include a short window title in the header bar using the existing monospace/hero font, such as a terminal-like string (e.g., \"mario@portfolio: ~\" or similar), styled to match the site’s existing heading/subheading treatments in size and weight.",
        "Overall header bar must feel minimal and flat, consistent with the site’s aesthetic; avoid gradients or skeuomorphic effects."

      "description": "Reformat the content inside the card to look like terminal output while preserving all existing information.",
      "requirements": [
        "Left-align the text content inside the card instead of centering it, so it reads like lines of terminal output.",
        "Keep the photo, but reduce its visual dominance: place it in a small rectangular or square area (e.g., top-right or top-left) with a thin border, optionally labeled as a file-like element (e.g., \"profile.png\") using existing text styles.",
        "Display name, role, location, focus, and status as simple key–value lines, e.g., a short label followed by the value on the same line, without complex layout logic.",
        "Maintain comfortable spacing between lines so that the card remains easy to scan and doesn’t feel crowded."

    "typography_and_colors": {
      "description": "Use existing fonts and palette to achieve a terminal vibe without introducing a new style system.",
      "requirements": [
        "Inside the card, switch labels and values to the existing monospace/hero font to echo a CLI feel.",
        "Use a dimmer gray for labels and a brighter neutral for values, both drawn from existing site colors.",
        "Keep font sizes consistent with the current card (or very close) to maintain readability and hierarchy with the rest of the About section.",
        "Use the existing accent color sparingly for items like focus tags or status text (e.g., \"Open to opportunities\"), not for entire blocks of text."

      "description": "Add a simple terminal prompt at the bottom as a visual flourish.",
      "requirements": [
        "Add a thin separator line above the bottom-most area of the card, matching other dividers used on the site.",
        "Below this line, add a single terminal-style prompt string (e.g., \"mario@portfolio:~$\"), using the existing monospace font and a small size.",
        "If a cursor indicator is included (e.g., \"_\" or a block), it should be static or have at most a very subtle blink that does not distract from reading the rest of the page.",
        "Ensure this footer area does not significantly increase the card height; it should be a small, tasteful detail."

    }
  },
  "responsiveness": {
    "requirements": [
      "On smaller screens, keep the card’s width and general proportions similar to the current implementation so it still pairs well with the text column or stacks cleanly when layout changes.",
      "Ensure that when the layout stacks vertically on mobile, the terminal-style card remains legible, with sufficient padding and line spacing.",
      "Avoid adding any layout that depends on very precise pixel-perfect alignment; keep the structure simple so it degrades gracefully at all breakpoints."
    ]
  },
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "The About profile card clearly reads as a minimal terminal/CLI-like window while matching the site’s existing dark, technical aesthetic.",
    "No new visual element feels out of place compared to the hero and projects sections (same general palette, fonts, and border styles).",
    "The card is not noticeably taller or wider than before, and the overall About section composition remains balanced.",
    "All existing information (photo, name, role, location, focus, status) is still present, easy to read, and clearly structured as terminal-style output.",
    "The implementation is visually simple and does not rely on complex behaviors or heavy animations."
