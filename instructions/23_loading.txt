You are redesigning the Loading Screen UI for a personal portfolio website with a very specific visual language:

Aesthetic: subtle, engineered, ASCII/terminal-inspired, monochrome, grid/dot background, thin rules/lines with small node dots. The landing (hero) section uses an “open-frame” look (long horizontal rules and minimal markers), NOT heavy boxed panels.

Goal:
Redesign the loading screen so it feels visually striking but still subtle (not overwhelming), and it should create the illusion that it “boots” and then seamlessly fades/expands into the landing page hero text + frame. Avoid over-engineering.

Hard constraints:
- Keep it simple (minimal elements).
- Do NOT use a full rectangular outline box around the loader.
- Avoid line overuse. Use the same rule/line style as the hero.
- The loader must feel like it belongs to the same system as the landing page and projects section.
- No cringe app-specific copy like “hydrating projects.”
- Text must use generic computer/boot language (neutral, system-like).
- Loader must not artificially delay loading (no forced 1.8s wait); it should be data-driven with a min display time to prevent flashing.

What to build (Layout v2: “Hero Boot Overlay”):
1) Background:
   - Use the same background treatment as the site (dark + subtle grid/dots + soft gradients).
   - The landing page (hero) should already be rendered behind the loader (dimmed and slightly blurred), so the loader feels like an overlay, not a separate page.

2) Loader frame (open-frame, not boxed):
   - Use only TWO thin horizontal rules (top + bottom), matching the hero rule thickness/opacity.
   - Add tiny node dots at ends (if the hero uses them).
   - No full border rectangle.

   Top rule label example:
   - Left label: “SYS”
   - Right label: “INIT” or “BOOT”
   Keep labels small, subtle.

3) Terminal text block (inside the open frame):
   - Left-aligned.
   - Tighter line-height and spacing so it reads like terminal output.
   - Show 3–5 lines maximum.
   - Include a blinking cursor ONLY on the current/active line.
   - Use generic boot/status language. Examples (choose 3–5 max):
     - “mario@portfolio:~$ init --ui”
     - “[ ok ] subsystem check”
     - “[ ok ] display sync”
     - “[ .. ] loading modules”
     - “[ ok ] link established”
     - “status: ONLINE”
   - Keep copy short and neutral. No app-specific words like “projects,” “hero,” “cards,” etc.

4) Progress indicator (stronger, but still subtle):
   - The BOTTOM rule doubles as the progress bar.
   - Implement a thin base line across the width.
   - Implement a fill line that grows left→right based on progress.
   - Add a small “scan dot” at the leading edge of the fill (optional) to match the node language.
   - Put percent (e.g., “62%”) at the far right in small text, aligned like other micro-labels in the hero UI.
   - Avoid chunky segmented blocks; prefer a clean engineered line fill consistent with the hero framing.

5) Transition into hero (the morph):
   - The loader should be positioned where the hero text block appears (same region/alignment).
   - On completion:
     - Terminal lines fade out top-to-bottom (fast, clean).
     - The top and bottom rules either:
       a) gently dissolve into the hero’s existing framing rules, OR
       b) remain briefly, then fade as the hero reaches full opacity.
     - The hero title and UI sharpen (remove blur) and ramp opacity to 1.
   - The transition should feel like “system online → UI appears,” not a hard cut.

Timing / behavior:
- Minimum loader time: 450–600ms (prevents flash).
- Maximum loader time: 1200ms unless real loading requires longer.
- Loader completion should be tied to real readiness (assets/data), not a fake timer.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion: if enabled, show a static minimal overlay (“SYS INIT” + “status: ONLINE”) then fade quickly.

Deliverables:
- Implement the redesigned loader component (React/Next.js friendly).
- Use existing styling system (Tailwind/shadcn if present).
- Keep code clean and not over-engineered.
- Provide animation implementation (Framer Motion or CSS transitions) that matches the site’s subtle easing.
- Include a simple configuration for progress value and ready state.
- Ensure the loader overlay does not break navigation/buttons once the hero is visible.

Acceptance checklist:
- No full rectangle box around loader.
- Visually matches hero rule style and micro-label language.
- Terminal text feels terminal-like (tight, left-aligned, blinking cursor).
- Progress bar is the bottom rule with line fill (stronger than before).
- Transition convincingly blends into the hero (hero is behind, sharpen+fade).
- Subtle and striking, not busy or overwhelming.
