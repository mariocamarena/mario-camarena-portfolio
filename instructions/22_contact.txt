Contact section

Goal: Instead of a generic form, make this feel like the last panel in your “console UI”.

Heading and framing

Style Let’s Connect in the same hero-style heading.

Add a top or side line (like a section frame) so the form feels like a terminal window.

Form fields

Switch labels to monospace all caps: NAME, EMAIL, MESSAGE.

Use outlined fields with the same border weight as hero buttons.

Add very subtle focus states that mimic the hero (slight glow or line accent).

Primary action

Make Send Message match the hero CTAs:

Outlined or filled in the same style as “VIEW PROJECTS” / “DOWNLOAD RESUME”.

Keep the icon, but maybe align it left and make the text all caps.

Social icons + footer

Add a small monospace label above the icons like FIND ME or SOCIAL.

For the footer with your name, echo the hero:

All caps, small tracking.

Maybe a tiny “PORTFOLIO.V2” or year stamp like your hero’s “PORTFOLIO_2025” tag.
