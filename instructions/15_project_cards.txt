Projects section

Goal: Your projects are the proof of what the hero claims. They should feel like high-tech panels, not generic cards.

Section heading

Change Featured Projects to match the hero heading style:

All caps, hero font, slightly increased tracking.

Add an underline or side line matching the hero’s name block.

Project cards

Make cards feel a bit more “terminal control panel”:

Use 1px bright outlines and slightly darker backgrounds (more contrast).

Consider a subtle top label bar on each card with a tiny monospace label:

PROJECT 01 – STABLES, PROJECT 02 – AD-SAM, etc.

Use the hero font for project titles and leave descriptions in the body font.

Integrate the dot/grid motif:

Tiny grid overlay on hover

A small dotted corner accent in one corner of each card.

Code / Demo buttons

Match the hero’s CTA style:

Outlined, all-caps monospace labels.

Consistent padding and hover states with the hero buttons.

Standardize the order (Demo then Code or vice versa) and alignment so the section feels more engineered.

Content balance

Add one line of concrete impact in each card (e.g., “Manages 828 spots across 3 lots” or “Improved mIoU from 0.3213 to 0.3958”) to match the seriousness of your hero tagline.
