## About section

**Goal:** Make this feel like the hero and project sections — same universe, just in paragraph form.

* **Title + top treatment**

  * Change `About Me` to **ALL CAPS with hero font + tracking**.
  * Add a **thin line above or below** the title similar to the hero’s name underline.
  * Consider a small label like `ABOUT` in a tiny monospace pill, to echo a terminal prompt.

* **Body copy block**

  * Narrow the text width slightly so it feels more column-like and intentional (closer to a technical doc).
  * Add **subhead labels** inside the text, e.g.:

    * `Research`, `Products`, `Interests`
    * Style these labels in all-caps monospace so they visually rhyme with the hero CTAs.
  * Slightly increase line-height and reduce paragraph length (more, shorter paragraphs) so it doesn’t feel like a wall of text.

* **Right-side profile card**

  * Give this card **stronger hero DNA**:

    * Outline or subtle double-border like the hero button outlines.
    * Tiny dot or “status LED” in the corner that matches the hero accent.
    * Use the hero font for your name + role.
  * Add **tiny metadata rows** in monospace:

    * `ROLE: Graduate Research Assistant`
    * `FOCUS: AAM Security, Computer Vision`
    * This mirrors the “terminal” vibe of the hero.

* **Skill chips**

  * Make chips look more like **hero micro-UI**:

    * Slightly sharper corners or thinner outlines.
    * All-caps monospace with tighter tracking.
  * Group chips under **explicit labeled rows** (`LANGUAGES`, `FRAMEWORKS`, etc.) that visually match the hero’s small labels.
